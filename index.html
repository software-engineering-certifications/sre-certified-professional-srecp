          <p class="text">This course provides an overview of the principles and methods that enable an organisation to
            scale key services reliably and economically. Site Reliability Engineering is a method of operations that
            uses software engineering and automation to ensure that continually delivered applications work smoothly and
            reliably. The Site Reliability Engineering course highlights the evolution of SRE in the DevOps field and
            its future direction, as well as providing participants with the practises, methods, and tools needed to
            engage people from all levels of the organisation in reliability and stability, as evidenced by real-life
            scenarios and case studies. Participants will have real takeaways to use when they return to the office
            after completing the SRE programme, such as understanding, defining, and tracking Service Level Objectives
            (SLOs). The Site Reliability Engineering course was curated to spread knowledge about the key principles and
            practises necessary for starting SRE adoption by capturing key SRE sources, engaging with thought-leaders in
            the SRE space, and working with organisations embracing SRE to extract real-life best practises.</p>

          <h3>What is Site Reliability
            <span>Engineering?</span></h3>
        </div>
        <p class="text">SRE stands for site reliability engineering, and it's a software engineering approach to IT
          operations. To manage systems, address problems, and automate operational duties, SRE teams use software. SRE
          delegated responsibilities previously performed by operations teams (typically manually) to engineers or
          operations teams, who employ software and automation to address problems and manage production systems. When
          it comes to building scalable and highly reliable software systems, SRE is a beneficial practise. It allows
          you to administer huge systems using code, which is more scalable and long-term for sysadmins handling tens of
          thousands or even millions of machines. Ben Treynor Sloss, a member of the Google engineering team, is
          credited with inventing the notion of site reliability engineering. SRE assists teams in striking a balance
          between releasing new features and ensuring their reliability for users. The SRE paradigm has two key
          components: standardisation and automation. Engineers in charge of site dependability should continually be
          searching for methods to improve and automate operational chores.</p>

        <p class="text">SRE helps to increase a system's reliability now while also enhancing it as it evolves over time
          in this way. It helps companies transition from a traditional IT operations methodology to a cloud-native
          approach.

          </div>
          <div class="col-7">
            <p>A site reliability engineer is a one-of-a-kind position that necessitates experience as a software
              developer with additional operations experience, or as a sysadmin or in an IT operations function with
              software development abilities.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>SRE teams are in charge of code deployment, configuration, and monitoring, as well as service
              availability, latency, change management, emergency response, and capacity management.</p>

            <p>By using service-level agreements (SLAs) to define the required dependability of the system through
              service-level indicators (SLI) and service-level objectives, site reliability engineering assists teams in
              determining what new features can be released and when (SLO).</p>

            <p>An SLI is a standardised metric for assessing particular components of a service's quality. Request
              latency, availability, error rate, and system throughput are all important SLIs. The goal value or range
              for a particular service level based on the SLI is used to create a SLO.</p>

            <p>Based on the agreed-upon allowable downtime, a SLO for the needed system reliability is subsequently
              determined. An error budget, or the maximum permissible threshold for errors and outages, is the term used
              to describe this level of downtime.</p>

            <p>SRE does not demand 100 percent reliability; failure is expected and accepted.</p>
            <p>When a new feature is released, the development team can "spent" the error budget. The development team
              can use the SLO and error budget to decide if a product or service can launch based on the available error
              budget.</p>

            <p>If a service is operating within its error budget, the development team can launch whenever they want;
              however, if the system is currently experiencing too many mistakes or is down for longer than the error
              budget permits, no new launches can be made until the errors are under control. To show reliability, the
              development team does automated operations tests. Engineers that work on site reliability spend their time
              between operations and project work. A site reliability engineer can only spend up to 50% of their time on
              operations, according to Google's SRE best practises, which should be monitored to ensure they don't go
              over.</p>

            <p>The remaining time should be dedicated to development chores such as adding new features, growing the
              system, and automating processes.</p>

            <p>Instead of the site reliability engineer spending too much time on the operations of an application or
              service, excess operational work and badly performing services can be redirected back to the dev team to
              run.</p>

            <p>The role of the site reliability engineer includes a significant amount of automation. They will automate
              a remedy if they are dealing with a problem on a regular basis. This also ensures that operations work
              does not exceed half of their total burden.</p>

            <p>An important component of SRE is maintaining a balance between operations and development effort.</p>

            <li>Provides visibility into the health of the service- Site reliability engineers have the best
              understanding of how everything in the system is connected. They understand how to manage metrics, logs,
              and traces across diverse services. And, if an incident occurs, the observability is already in place,
              allowing on-call responders to quickly obtain context.</li>
            <li>It acts as a link between developers and operations- Site reliability engineers bridge the gap between
              developers and Ops. They are equally accountable for creating a reliable, fast CI/CD pipeline. SRE can
              highlight areas for improvement in the release pipeline. It can also establish guidelines for on-call
              availability and incident response that encourage everyone to take responsibility.</li>
            <li>The team is relocated to a contemporary NOC- You need a mechanism for responding to application and IT
              infrastructure warnings. This was usually done through a centralized command Centre – the network
              operations Centre. SRE is moving toward a modern NOC where warnings are sent directly to the person
              responsible for resolving the relevant problem.</li>
            <li>Organizing on-call structures and alerting workflows- Site reliability engineers will know the best way
              to build an on-call process and how to optimize the system for alerts. Every tech stack and organizational
              structure will differ, so it's important to take a step back and think objectively about the best
              approach. SREs can help objectively determine the best ways to route alerts through systems.</li>

            <li>Concerns about manufacturing should be factored into the product strategy- Site reliability engineers
              have the most visibility into what's wrong with production environments. It's their job to create
              visibility into service health to improve incident response. But it's also important to point out flaws
              that need to be fixed and prioritised in a team's product roadmap.</li>

                    DevOps is a culture, automation, and platform design strategy aimed at increasing business value and
                    responsiveness by delivering high-quality services quickly. SRE might be regarded a DevOps
                    implementation.
                  </p>
                  <p>SRE is all about team culture and relationships, just as DevOps. Both SRE and DevOps aim to reduce
                    the time it takes to offer services by bridging the gap between development and operations teams.
                  </p>

                  <p>Both DevOps and SRE approaches can result in shorter application development life cycles, increased
                    service quality and dependability, and lower IT time per application built.</p>

                  <p>SRE is unique in that it relies on site reliability engineers with an operations background who are
                    part of the development team to eliminate communication and workflow issues.</p>

                  <p>By necessitating an overlap in tasks, the site reliability engineer role itself integrates the

                  <p>SRE can assist DevOps teams whose developers are overburdened with operations responsibilities and
